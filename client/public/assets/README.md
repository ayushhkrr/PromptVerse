# Starry Background Image

Please add your starry night background image here and name it:
**starry-bg.jpg**

The image will be used as the background for:
- Home page
- Login page
- Register page

## Instructions:
1. Save your starry night image as `starry-bg.jpg`
2. Place it in this directory: `client/public/assets/`
3. The pages will automatically use this image as their background

## Alternative:
If you want to use a different image format (PNG, WebP, etc.), update the file extension in:
- `client/src/pages/Home.jsx` (line 50)
- `client/src/pages/Login.jsx` (line 69)
- `client/src/pages/Register.jsx` (line 80)

Change `url(/assets/starry-bg.jpg)` to your image filename.
